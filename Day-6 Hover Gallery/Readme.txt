Hover Gallery: Showcase Your Photos
This project is part of my Web Development Daily Practice Challenge, where I build a new mini-project every day to improve my frontend skills.

CSS properties like filter, transition, and hover are used to achieve the effect.

Reusable Design:
Can be implemented in galleries, portfolios, or showcases.
