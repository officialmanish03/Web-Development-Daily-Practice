EMI Calculator
The EMI Calculator is a web-based application that calculates the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) for loans. It's a simple yet powerful tool for understanding loan repayments, and it was built as part of my Web Development Daily Practice Challenge.

P: Loan amount
R: Monthly interest rate (
Annual rate / 12 × 100)
N: Loan tenure in months

User-Friendly Input Fields:
Interactive input for loan amount and interest rate.
Dropdown for selecting loan tenure in years.
